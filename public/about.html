<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Mohamed, and I am a Bachelor's student at Vilnius University,
  pursuing a degree in Software Engineering with a specialization in Web
  Development. Before diving into the world of programming, I spent over 10
  years in marketing and B2B sales, particularly with Samsung, from 2013 to
  2023. Driven by my passion, I decided to take a career shift into software
  engineering and am now designing my portfolio as a web developer.
</p>
<p>
  I have solid knowledge in procedural programming, object-oriented programming,
  data structures and algorithms, functional programming, and, of course, web
  development. Below are some of the programming languages I am proficient in:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>C++</li>
  <li>PHP</li>
  <li>C#</li>
  <li>F#</li>
  <li>... and I am continuously learning and improving.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  My goal is to become a professional in Web development and leave a signature
  of excellence wherever I work.
